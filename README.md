# Face-Detection-System
This is a face recognition system which detects a face on a video capture and identifies the person.
If that person is present in a database then his attendance of that day with a time is captured and stored on a database.
I've made this project using python modules like mediapipe, cv2, PyQt, sqlite3, time and many more...
I am working on an update where at the end of month graphs are shown of student with most absent, most present, average present, etc that includes my skill of matplotlib module.
THANK YOU!
